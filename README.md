# Spatial temperature trend estimation with SPDE-INLA

Example of a spatial trend analysis of gridded temperature data using SPDE-INLA and excursion sets. 

The code reproduces one of the analyses in the paper 

O. Haug, T.L. Thorarinsdottir, S.H. SÃ¸rbye and C.L.E. Franzke (2019): Spatial trend analysis of gridded temperature data at varying spatial scales. 

A preprint of the paper is also available. 

The code is written by Ola Haug.
